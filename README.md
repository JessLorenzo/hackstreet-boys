# 🎬 Hackstreet Boys – A Gamified Movie Recommender

Welcome to **Hackstreet Boys**, a full-stack web app built during a 24-hour Warner Bros. industry hackathon challenge. Our mission? Reimagine content discovery on Max (formerly HBO Max) to increase engagement, enhance retention, and promote premium subscriptions.

## 🧠 The Idea

Hackstreet Boys turns onboarding into an interactive experience using **gamified trivia** to generate personalized movie recommendations.

Instead of passive browsing, users take a fun quiz. Their answers are transformed into a **genre fingerprint** — a vector representing their movie preferences. We then compare this vector against the genre profiles of movies using **cosine similarity** to recommend the best matches.

## 🔥 Key Features

- 🎲 **Trivia-Driven Onboarding**: Answer 4 quick questions to unlock your personalized movie suggestions.
- 🧠 **Genre-Based Recommendation System**: Responses build a unique user genre profile.
- 🎁 **Reward Mechanism**: Correct answers unlock points or trials — driving users back daily.
- 💡 **Subscription Tier Nudging**: Limited access for standard users, with prompts to upgrade for unlimited plays.
- 📈 **Scalable A/B Testing Strategy**: Designed for growth, with phased rollout and experimentation built-in.
